  ## **Planning**


  ### **External user goals**
  
- I want to take part in a sneaker quiz online and improve my general knowledge. I want to be able to play at any time, anywhere.
- I want the site to be responsive to my device.
- I want the site to be easy to navigate.
- I want to be able to log my high scores to see how I am performing.

  ### **Site owner goals**

  - provide test sneaker heads with whether they understand the general knowledge of sneakers
  - get people to sign up for events
 
    ### **User Stories**

    - As a user, I want to navigate the quiz using multiple devices.
    - As a user, I want to find general information about the quiz.
    - As a user, I want to find out whats my score
    - As a user, I want to find how many questions did I get right and wrong .
    - As a user, I want to find my score after playing the game.
    

### **Features to achieve the goals**

The website is comprised of a home page, a games page, a high scores page, a 404 error page .

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:
    - The website will be built with a mobile-first approach, to ensure it is responsive. I will also test it on various devices and screen sizes.
    - General information about the quiz like how to play  will be included in the home page .
    - A favicon in the browser tab.
    - The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.


### **Wireframes**

I created wireframes to visualize my ideas using [Figma](docs/wireframe/wireframe.png) . As I want to stick to the mobile-first approach I created wireframes for mobile.
  
### **Color Scheme**

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Red and white  are very typical colours in use.

Then I used http://colormind.io/to find matching colors for my scheme. After picking out my five main colors I used [contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%2383a603%0D%0A%231b4001%0D%0A%23f0deb4%0D%0A%23f6f7eb%0D%0A%23001e1d&es-color-form__tile-size=regular&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast and possible color combinations.
